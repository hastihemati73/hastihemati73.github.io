Hello! Welcome to my website!

I'm Hasti, a PhD candidate in Sustainable Development at Columbia University. My research focuses on disasters and recovery, with a specific interest in floods and wildfires.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering and a Master's degree in Water Resources Engineering and Management. I have professional experience as a GIS Administrator, Project Designer, and Technical Researcher in the water resources sector.

Outside of my research, I enjoy playing squash, dancing, and cooking.
